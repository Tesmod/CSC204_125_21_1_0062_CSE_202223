Question 1 15 marks.
Task 1. Using the python programming language perform the following task: 5 marks.
i. Create Node class in package nodes (Hint: stores data and link to a node) 1 mark.
ii. Create Single Linked List class in package linkedlists. 4 marks.
Test with this [1,3,4,5,6,8,7,9,2,22,15,55,45,23,24,26,28]. (Hint: Create insert and display methods first
then other list operations)
iii. Create a main.py to test run your codes. 1 mark.

Task 2. 
Implement the following linked list operations. You can use class(es) created in Task 1. 10 marks.
i. Method to display the maximum and minimum data in the single linked list. 4 marks
ii. Method that converts the single linked list into a binary search tree. This method takes a python list
as argument. (Test this method using this list [1,3,4,5,6,8,7,9,2,22,15,55,45,23,24,26,28] on a new single
linked list object). 4 marks
